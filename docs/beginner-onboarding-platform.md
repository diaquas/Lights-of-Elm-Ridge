# Lights of Elm Ridge — Beginner Onboarding Platform

## "From Inspired to Illuminated"

A guided, project-management-style implementation program that takes someone from "I saw a cool light show on YouTube" to a fully operational, music-synchronized pixel display on their house — with Lights of Elm Ridge as the guide, toolset, and supply chain partner at every step.

## The Problem

The pixel holiday lighting hobby has a brutal onramp. The journey looks like this today:

```
Sees a viral light show video                    → 100,000+ people/year
Joins a Facebook group, starts asking questions   → ~10,000
Gets overwhelmed by jargon, conflicting advice    → ████████████ DROP OFF
Actually orders hardware                          → ~3,000-5,000
Receives boxes, has no idea how to wire it        → ████████████ DROP OFF
Gets something working (barely)                   → ~2,000
Buys sequences, can't map them to their display   → ████████████ DROP OFF
Has a show they're proud of                       → ~1,500
```

Three massive drop-off points. Three products that solve them:

| Drop-off | Cause | Solution |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Research → Purchase | Don't know what to buy, how much, or from where | **Shop Wizard 2.0** |
| Boxes → Working Display | Don't know how to wire, power, or test it | **xWire** |
| Sequences → Show | Can't map purchased sequences to their layout | **Mod:IQ** |

The insight: **you already have the bookends** (Shop Wizard and Mod:IQ). The middle is the biggest gap, and xWire fills it. What ties them together is the guided program.

## The Platform: Implementation Program

Think of it like an onboarding experience for enterprise software — but for a hobby. A step-by-step guided program with milestones, progress tracking, and the right tool or video at exactly the right moment.

## Vendor Partnership Model

Every hardware recommendation in the platform is a revenue opportunity. The model:

### Affiliate / Commission Structure

| Vendor Type | Examples | Commission Model |
|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| Pixel + strip suppliers | HolidayCoro, Ray Wu | 5-10% affiliate commission |
| Controller manufacturers | Falcon, HinksPix, Kulp | 5-8% or store credit referral |
| Prop makers (coro) | Boscoyo, HolidayCoro | 5-10% affiliate |
| HD prop makers | Gilbert Engineering | Partnership / co-marketing |
| General hardware | Amazon | Amazon Associates (3-4%) |
| Power supplies | Amazon, specialty | Amazon Associates |

### Value Proposition to Vendors

"Lights of Elm Ridge sends you qualified, ready-to-buy customers with a specific shopping list. They know exactly what they need, in the right quantities, from your store. No tire-kicking."

What you offer vendors:
- **Pre-qualified traffic**: Users arrive at vendor sites with a specific shopping list, not browsing. Conversion rates will be high.
- **Reduced support burden**: Users who go through the program won't email vendors asking "what do I need?" — they already know.
- **Co-branded content**: "Recommended by Lights of Elm Ridge" badge on vendor product pages.
- **Data**: "We sent X users to your store this month, they purchased $Y on average."

### Revenue Tiers

| Tier | Model | Revenue |
|------|-------|---------|
| Free tier | Orientation video, basic shop wizard | Free (top of funnel) |
| Sequence purchases | Individual sequences + catalog | $15-30 per sequence |
| xWire | Wiring diagram generation | $10-20 per layout or bundled with first sequence purchase |
| Mod:IQ | Included free with every sequence | Drives sequence sales volume |
| Vendor commissions | Affiliate links on all hardware | 3-10% of referred sales |
| Premium support | "Review my wiring plan" / custom help | $50-100 per session |

### Revenue Math (Conservative)

If 1,000 new hobbyists/year go through the program:
- Average hardware spend: $2,000 × 7% blended commission = **$140/user** = **$140K/year**
- Average first-year sequence spend: $150 × 1,000 = **$150K/year**
- xWire: $15 × 1,000 = **$15K/year**
- Year 2+ retention (60%): 600 users × $100 sequences = **$60K/year** (compounds)

**Year 1: ~$305K** | **Year 2: ~$365K** | **Year 3: ~$400K+**

And this is conservative — it assumes 1,000 users/year through the full program. The onboarding platform itself could grow the hobby's conversion rate, meaning more than the current ~3,000 new hobbyists/year actually make it through.

## The Project Dashboard (UX)

The user's experience should feel like a project tracker — not a list of pages to find. After they click "Start My Project," they get a personal dashboard:

## Video Content Plan

| # | Video | Length | Purpose |
|---|-------|--------|---------|
| V1 | "So You Want to Do a Light Show" | 8-10 min | Inspire + set expectations. Show range of displays. Honest about cost/time. End with "ready? let's go." |
| V2 | "Designing Your Display" | 5 min | Companion to Shop Wizard. How to think about layout, what props do what, budget allocation. |
| V3 | "Your Order Arrived — Now What" | 10-15 min | Unboxing, inventory, component ID, bench testing every item before install. |
| V4 | "Reading Your Wiring Diagram" | 8 min | How to read xWire output. What the colors mean, where to run cables, power injection explained simply. |
| V5 | "Installing Your Display" | 12-15 min | Physical installation: mounting, cable management, waterproofing, test-as-you-go methodology. |
| V6 | "Putting It to Music" | 10 min | What sequences are, buying vs DIY, how Mod:IQ mapping works, loading onto FPP. |
| V7 | "Going Live" | 8 min | FPP scheduling, FM transmitter, signage, neighbor management, filming tips. |
| V8 | "Year 2: What's Next" | 5 min | Expansion options, new sequences, adding holidays, community events. |

Total production: 8 videos, ~75-85 minutes of content. This is the backbone — each video is the "teacher" that makes the tools approachable.

## Build Priority

What to build and in what order:

### Now (you have it or it's close)
- ✅ Sequence catalog (live on lightsofelmridge.com)
- ✅ Mod:IQ (in development, tickets 68-87)
- ✅ Shop Wizard v1 (exists, needs revamp)

### Phase 1: The Funnel Top (highest leverage, lowest build cost)
1. **V1: Orientation video** — Film this first. It's the entry point for everything.
2. **Project Dashboard** — Simple progress tracker. Even before other tools are ready, the structure shows users the path exists.
3. **Vendor partnerships** — Start conversations with Boscoyo, HolidayCoro, GE. Show them the concept. Get affiliate links set up.
4. **Shop Wizard 2.0 + Layout Generator** — Revamp the existing wizard with photo upload, prop previews, vendor-linked shopping lists with affiliate codes, and .rgbeffects file export (see Layout File Generation below).

---

## Layout File Generation: Shop Wizard → xLights

The killer handoff: when a user finishes the Shop Wizard, they download an `.rgbeffects` file that opens directly in xLights with their entire display pre-built. No manual model creation. No guessing at pixel counts or channel assignments. They open xLights and their display is there.

### What the .rgbeffects File Contains

The .rgbeffects file is XML. Each model definition includes:

```xml
<model name="Arch 1" DisplayAs="Arches" StringType="RGB Nodes"
       parm1="25" parm2="1" parm3="1"
       StartSide="B" Dir="L" Antialias="1"
       PixelCount="25" PixelType="Square"
       StartChannel=">!Controller:1:1"
       LayoutGroup="Default"
       WorldPosX="2.5" WorldPosY="1.0" WorldPosZ="0.0"
       ScaleX="1.0" ScaleY="0.5" />
```

Key attributes per model:
- **DisplayAs**: Model type (Arches, Tree, Candy Canes, Matrix, Custom, Spinner, etc.)
- **parm1/2/3**: Type-specific parameters (pixel count, string count, strands, etc.)
- **StartChannel**: Controller port assignment using xLights reference format
- **WorldPos/Scale**: 2D layout positioning
- **StringType**: Always "RGB Nodes" for pixel props

### Model Templates (What Shop Wizard Knows)

Each prop in the Shop Wizard maps to an xLights model template with sensible defaults:

```
PROP SELECTION              → xLIGHTS MODEL
─────────────────────────────────────────────
House Outline (roof)        → Poly Line, pixel count from measured linear feet
House Outline (windows)     → Poly Line or Custom (rectangle)
Mega Tree                   → Tree (strings × pixels-per-string)
Arches (set of N)           → N × Arches models, 25-50px each
Candy Canes (set of N)      → N × Single Line, 25-50px each
Singing Face (pumpkin/bulb) → Custom model with submodels (pre-built)
Pixel Forest (N trees)      → N × Tree models, 100-200px each
Matrix                      → Matrix (rows × cols from panel size)
HD Spinner                  → Spinner + submodel file from GE library
Fireworks                   → Custom model from Boscoyo template
Snowflakes                  → Custom model from vendor template
Star (tree topper)          → Star model
Floods                      → Single Line, 1-3px per flood
```

### Controller Auto-Assignment

The wizard knows which controller they selected (Falcon F48, HinksPix, Kulp, etc.). Auto-assign ports sequentially:

```
Port 1:  House Outline - Roof Left      (150px, ch 1-450)
Port 2:  House Outline - Roof Right     (120px, ch 451-810)
Port 3:  House Outline - Garage         (80px, ch 811-1050)
Port 4:  Mega Tree String 1             (200px, ch 1051-1650)
Port 5:  Mega Tree String 2             (200px, ch 1651-2250)
...
Port 12: Arch 1                         (25px)
Port 13: Arch 2                         (25px)
...
```

Use xLights' controller reference format: `>!ControllerName:Port:StartPixel` so the file is controller-aware from day one.

### Layout Positioning from House Photo

When the user uploads their house photo and marks where props go (checkboxes or drag-and-drop on the photo), convert those screen coordinates to xLights WorldPos coordinates:

```
Photo coordinate (x%, y%) → WorldPos mapping:
  - Photo width maps to xLights X range (-10 to 10)
  - Photo height maps to xLights Y range (0 to 10)
  - Props placed on roof → Y = 7-9
  - Props placed on ground/yard → Y = 0-2
  - Props placed mid-house → Y = 3-6
  - Left-to-right position preserved
```

This doesn't need to be pixel-perfect — it just needs to give them a reasonable starting point so they don't open xLights to 30 models all stacked on top of each other at position (0,0).

### Pre-Built Submodel Files for Complex Props

For HD spinners, singing faces, and other props with submodels, include the vendor's submodel definitions in the export:

- **GE Spinners**: Submodel groups from the cross-reference data (we already have this for 74 props)
- **Singing Faces**: Standard submodel layout (eyes, mouth, outline, etc.)
- **Boscoyo Props**: Standard submodel definitions from their model files

These can be bundled as separate .xmodel files alongside the .rgbeffects, or embedded directly in the XML.

### The Export Flow

```
User completes Shop Wizard
         ↓
System generates:
  1. rgbeffects XML file (full layout with all models)
  2. Controller configuration notes (text/PDF)
  3. Shopping list with vendor links
  4. xWire input data (for later wiring diagram generation)
         ↓
User downloads "My Display Package":
  📁 MyLightShow/
  ├── MyDisplay.rgbeffects        ← Open this in xLights
  ├── controller-setup.pdf         ← Port assignments reference
  ├── shopping-list.pdf            ← Vendor links + quantities
  └── README.txt                   ← "Open MyDisplay.rgbeffects in xLights"
         ↓
User opens xLights → File → Open Layout
         ↓
Their display appears, models positioned, controllers assigned
         ↓
Video V2 walks them through fine-tuning positions and parameters
```

### What "Dialing It In" Looks Like (V2 Video Content)

The companion video covers:
1. Opening the generated file in xLights
2. Switching to Layout tab — "here's your display, already built"
3. Dragging models to exact positions (matching their actual house)
4. Adjusting pixel counts if actual strand lengths differ from plan
5. Setting up the Preview (what their display looks like when rendered)
6. First render test with a test sequence to verify everything lights up correctly
7. Saving — this file is now their master layout for everything going forward

The video message is: "We built 80% of this for you. Now let's get the last 20% dialed in. This should take about 30 minutes."

### Technical Build Notes

- The .rgbeffects XML schema is well-documented in the xLights source code and wiki
- Generate the XML server-side (Node.js or Python) from the wizard's output data
- Validate the generated file by loading it in a headless xLights instance (or against the XSD)
- Version the template library — when xLights updates their schema, update templates
- Consider hosting a model file library for vendor props (GE spinners, Boscoyo coro, etc.) that auto-includes the right .xmodel files

### Networks File Generation (xlights_networks.xml)

The second file to generate. This defines the controller hardware so the user doesn't have to touch the Controllers tab at all.

**Schema:**
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Networks computer="" GlobalFPPProxy="" GlobalForceLocalIP=""
         AutoUpdateFromBase="0" BaseShowDir="">
  <suppressframes frames="20"/>

**Key fields per controller:**
- `Vendor` + `Model`: Must match xLights' known controller list (HinksPix PRO V3, Falcon F48, AlphaPix 16, etc.)
- `IP`: Default to `192.168.1.100` — user changes this to match their actual controller IP. Call out in video.
- `Protocol`: E131 for most setups (DDP is an option but E131 is more beginner-friendly)
- `AutoSize="1"` + `AutoLayout="1"`: Let xLights auto-manage channel allocation — critical for beginners
- `FullxLightsControl="TRUE"`: xLights manages the controller config directly

**Universe calculation per package:**
```
Pixels × 3 channels = total channels
Total channels ÷ 510 = universes needed (round up)

Starter:  ~1,500px × 3 = 4,500ch → 9 universes  → 1 controller
Yard:     ~5,000px × 3 = 15,000ch → 30 universes → 1 controller
Full:     ~12,000px × 3 = 36,000ch → 71 universes → 1-2 controllers
Beast:    ~25,000px × 3 = 75,000ch → 148 universes → 2-3 controllers
```

**Controller selection per package:**

| Package | Recommended Controller | Why |
|---------|----------------------|-----|
| Starter | Falcon F4V3 or AlphaPix 4 | 4 ports, cheap, enough for outline + canes |
| Yard Show | Falcon F16V4 or HinksPix PRO | 16 ports, room to grow |
| Full Production | HinksPix PRO V3 | 16+ ports, differential receivers for long runs |
| The Beast | HinksPix PRO V3 + expansion | Multi-controller, long range receivers |

**What we DON'T ask the user:**
- Universe numbers (we calculate them)
- Channel counts (we calculate them)
- Protocol details (we default E131)
- Port assignments (we auto-assign based on prop order)

**What the user DOES need to do (covered in video):**
1. Change the IP address to match their controller
2. Plug in their controller and verify xLights discovers it
3. Hit "Upload" in xLights to push the config to the controller

That's it. Three steps. Everything else is pre-configured.

### Complete Download Package (Updated)

```
📁 MyLightShow/
├── xlights_rgbeffects.xml     ← Layout: all models, positions, groups
├── xlights_networks.xml       ← Controllers: ports, universes, channels
├── controller-setup.pdf       ← "Change IP to your controller's IP"
├── shopping-list.pdf          ← Vendor links + quantities + affiliate codes
├── wiring-overview.pdf        ← Simplified wiring diagram (xWire lite)
└── README.txt                 ← "Copy both XML files into a new xLights
                                  show folder. Open xLights. Done."
```

The user creates a new show folder in xLights, drops in the two XML files, opens xLights, and sees their full display — controllers configured, models placed, groups organized. The only manual step is updating the controller IP.

### Phase 2: The Critical Middle
5. **V3-V5: Build phase videos** — Film these during your own setup season. Real footage, real problems, real solutions.
6. **xWire MVP** — Start with the core: read xLights layout → output a static wiring diagram image + power injection points + cable list. Doesn't need to be interactive yet — a PDF/image output is huge value on its own.
7. **Testing Helper** — Could be as simple as a troubleshooting decision tree page with FPP test pattern downloads.

### Phase 3: Polish + Growth
8. **Free starter sequence** — Create one killer sequence designed to work on any layout via Mod:IQ. The "first hit is free" conversion tool.
9. **Interactive xWire** — Upgrade from static output to interactive diagram (zoom, click props for detail, drag to adjust).
10. **V6-V8: Show phase videos** — Film during show season with real audience footage.
11. **Community showcase** — User-submitted display videos, categorized by size/budget.

## The Moat

This platform creates a defensible position that individual sequence vendors can't replicate:

1. **You own the full journey.** No one else covers discover → buy → wire → sequence → show. Everyone else does one piece.
2. **Vendor relationships compound.** As you send more qualified traffic, vendors give better commission rates or exclusive deals.
3. **Data flywheel.** Every display plan through Shop Wizard tells you what props are popular, what budget ranges sell, where users drop off. This informs your sequence catalog (make sequences for the props people actually buy).
4. **xWire + Mod:IQ share a data model.** Both read xLights layout files. Building one makes the other better. No competitor has both.
5. **Content library grows.** Each video is evergreen. Each new season adds community footage. The content moat deepens every year.
6. **Beginner lock-in is real.** If someone's first experience with the hobby is through your platform, they'll buy sequences from you, use your tools, and follow your vendor recommendations for years. The switching cost is trust + familiarity, not technology.

## Working Title Ideas

The platform needs a name. The program itself — not just the site. Ideas:

- **LightPath** — "Your path from inspired to illuminated"
- **FirstLight** — "Your first light show starts here"
- **ShowBuilder** — Straightforward, describes what it is
- **LightLaunch** — "Launch your light show"
- **The Elm Ridge Method** — Premium, branded approach

Or keep it simple: **"Start Your Show"** as the CTA, with the program living at `lightsofelmridge.com/start`.
