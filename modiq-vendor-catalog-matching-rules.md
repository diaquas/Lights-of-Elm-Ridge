## V2 Enhanced Matching Rules

### Rule 1: Vendor Fingerprinting

Many props can be identified by their exact pixel count, which acts like a fingerprint.

**Implementation:** When ModIQ sees a model with a specific pixel count that matches a known vendor product, it can infer the manufacturer and product, which unlocks the submodel answer key.

| Pixel Count | Likely Prop |
|-------------|-------------|
| 269 | CCC 18" Spinner |
| 451 | CCC 24" Spinner |
| 519 | CCC 25" Spinner |
| 596 | CCC 36" Spinner |
| 640 | GE Flake 640 |
| 800 | EFL Showstopper Spinner (approx) |
| 1,046 | CCC 48" Spinner |
| 1,117 | Boscoyo Mesmerizer |
| 1,529 | GE Overlord |
| 240 | Boscoyo Mega Spinner 48" |
| 99 | Boscoyo ChromaCane 99 |
| 175 | Sidewalk Spectaculars Buttercup Flower |

**Caution:** Pixel counts aren't unique across all props — two different 150-pixel props could be a snowflake or an arch. Use pixel count as a *supporting* signal alongside model type, never as the sole identifier.

### Rule 2: Hybrid Prop Detection

Several popular props combine multiple functional types into one physical prop. ModIQ needs to recognize these and map them at the submodel level.

**Known hybrid categories:**
- **Snowflake + Spinner:** Many ChromaFlakes have a "spinner" submodel using the arm arrangement. A "snowflake" in one layout might map to a "spinner" submodel in another.
- **Arch + Matrix:** Boscoyo Fan Arch with Matrix has a 7-row matrix in the top of an arch shape.
- **Arch + Snowflake:** Charlees Snowflake Arch combines both.
- **Wreath + Face:** GE MOAW is a wreath that also has singing face submodels.
- **Flower + Spinner:** Sidewalk Spectaculars flowers have spinner-like tops.
- **Star + Snowflake:** "Starflake" hybrids exist from multiple vendors.

**Rule:** When a model is classified as a hybrid, map each functional submodel group independently. The "arch" portion maps to arches, the "matrix" portion maps to matrices, etc.

### Rule 3: Native vs. Custom Model Awareness

xLights has built-in model types (Arch, Spinner, Star, Tree, etc.) AND custom models (.xmodel files). Some props work better as native models, others require custom models.

**Key insight from Charlees Props:** Stars often use native xLights star models because the "Star Layer" render style (only available on native models) produces better effects than custom models. So a user's star may be a native Star model with specific layer configuration, NOT a custom model.

**Mapping implication:** When the source layout uses a native Spinner (6 arms × 20 pixels/arm = 120 total) and the destination has a custom model spinner with 1,529 pixels, these are fundamentally different prop scales. ModIQ should flag the mismatch and suggest the user verify.

**Rule:** Track whether models are native xLights types or custom imports. Weight native↔native and custom↔custom matches higher than cross-type matches.

### Rule 4: PPD Certified Model Groups

Pixel Pro Displays has established a standardized grouping system for their Pro Layout sequences. Many users in the community have adopted these group names, making them a de facto standard.

**Known PPD group names:**
- Spinner Alert (spinner-specific effects)
- Whole House
- All Arches
- All Snowflakes
- Snowflake Tower (6 stacked snowflakes)
- All Trees / Mini Trees
- All Candy Canes
- Rooflines
- Windows
- Matrix

**Rule:** When ModIQ encounters PPD group names in a user's layout, it should recognize these as standardized categories and use them as strong matching signals. A model inside a "Spinner Alert" group is almost certainly a spinner, regardless of its DisplayAs type.

### Rule 5: Size Variant Matching

Multiple vendors sell the same prop type in different sizes. The pixel count scales roughly proportionally with physical size.

**Example — CCC Spinners:**
```
18" → 269 nodes
24" → 451 nodes  
25" → 519 nodes
36" → 596 nodes
48" → 1,046 nodes
```

**Rule:** When matching spinners (or any category with size variants), prefer mapping large↔large and small↔small. Use the pixel count ratio to estimate relative size. A 1,046-node spinner should map to the largest spinner in the source layout, not the smallest.

### Rule 6: Snowflake Prong Variants

Boscoyo alone has 2-prong, 3-prong, 5-prong, hexagonal, diamond, and star variants of ChromaFlakes at multiple sizes (12", 16", 23", 24", 36", 47"). The submodel structures differ between prong counts.

**Rule:** When matching snowflakes, prong count matters for submodel mapping but NOT for top-level matching. A 2-prong ChromaFlake 24 should still map to a 3-prong ChromaFlake 24 at the model level — the effects will render. But at the submodel level, arm-to-arm mapping needs to account for the different prong structures.

**Prong detection:** Count the number of arm-type submodels. If a snowflake has 6 arm submodels, it's likely a 3-prong (2 arms per prong). If it has 4, it's likely a 2-prong.

### Rule 7: Singing Face Props Need Special Handling

Singing face props (singing trees, tombstones, snowmen, etc.) have unique submodel requirements: mouth shapes (phoneme mapping), eyes, outline. These MUST map face-to-face.

**Known singing face props:**
- GE 30" Singing Tree
- GE MOAW (singing wreath)
- Charlees Singing Tombstone
- CCC Singing Frog
- Various community singing trees

**Rule:** If a model has submodels named any variation of "mouth", "eyes", "phoneme", "face", or xLights face definition data, classify it as a singing face prop. Only map singing faces to other singing faces, regardless of the outer prop shape (a singing tree should never map to a non-singing tree).

### Rule 8: Name Pattern Recognition

After analyzing hundreds of model names across vendors and community files, these patterns emerge:

**Vendor prefixes commonly found in model names:**
```
"GE_"  / "GE "    → Gilbert Engineering
"Boscoyo"          → Boscoyo Studio
"PPD"              → Pixel Pro Displays certified model
"CCC"              → Custom Christmas Creations
"EFL"              → EFL Designs
"SOL"              → SOL Sequencing (enhanced models)
"SS_" / "SS "      → Sidewalk Spectaculars
```

**Common naming patterns:**
```
"Arch" / "arch" / "ARC"                → Arch
"Spinner" / "spinner" / "SPIN"         → Spinner
"Flake" / "flake" / "ChromaFlake"      → Snowflake
"Tree" / "tree" / "MiniTree"           → Tree
"MegaTree" / "Mega"                    → Mega Tree (distinct from mini tree)
"Star" / "star" / "ChromaStar"         → Star
"Wreath" / "wreath" / "MOAW" / "BOAW" → Wreath
"Cane" / "cane" / "CC" / "ChromaCane"  → Candy Cane
"Matrix" / "matrix" / "P5" / "P10"    → Matrix
"Icicle" / "icicle"                    → Icicles
"Tombstone" / "tomb" / "Tomb"          → Tombstone
"Roofline" / "roof" / "outline"        → Outline/Roofline
"Window" / "window" / "WF"             → Window Frame
"Flood" / "flood" / "FL"              → Flood Light
"Pixel Pole" / "PixelPole" / "PP"      → Pixel Pole/Stake
```

**Positional naming patterns:**
```
"_L" / "_Left" / "_Lt" / "Left"       → Left side
"_R" / "_Right" / "_Rt" / "Right"     → Right side
"_C" / "_Center" / "_Ctr" / "Center"  → Center
"_F" / "_Front"                        → Front
"_B" / "_Back"                         → Back
"Roof" / "roof"                        → Upper zone
"Yard" / "yard" / "Ground"            → Lower zone
"Garage" / "garage"                    → Garage zone
"Driveway" / "DW" / "dw"              → Driveway
```

**Numbering patterns:**
```
"_1" / "-1" / " 1" / "01"             → Sequential numbering (L→R typical)
"Arch 1", "Arch 2", "Arch 3"          → Numbered group
"A1", "A2" or "Arch_L1", "Arch_R1"    → Abbreviated + numbered
```

### Rule 9: Model Group Intelligence

xLights allows users to create model groups. The group a model belongs to tells you a lot about what it is and how it's used.

**Common group naming patterns:**
- "All Arches" / "Arches" → all arch models
- "Whole House" → everything (used for full-display effects)
- "Roofline" → house outline models
- "Yard" / "Yard Props" → ground-level models
- Vendor-specific: "Spinner Alert" (PPD), "Snowflake Tower" (PPD)

**Rule:** Parse model groups from the rgbeffects file. If a model named "custom_prop_7" is in a group called "All Arches", it's almost certainly an arch regardless of its DisplayAs value or name.

### Rule 10: Submodel Name Standardization

Even across vendors, submodel names follow loose patterns. ModIQ should normalize these for matching:

| Submodel Patterns | Normalized Category |
|---|---|
| Arm1, Arm_A, Spoke1, Leg1, Blade1 | arm |
| Ring1, Ring_Outer, Circle1, Loop1 | ring |
| Center, Centre, Hub, Middle | center |
| Sweep, SweepCW, SweepCCW, WaveCW | sweep |
| Spinner, SpinnerTop, Spin | spinner (submodel within a larger prop) |
| Mouth, Face, Phoneme | face |
| Eyes, Eye_L, Eye_R | eyes |
| Outline, Border, Edge, Ring1 (outermost) | outline |
| Stem, Trunk | stem |
| Leaves, Leaf, Petal, Petals | foliage |
| Matrix, Panel, Screen | matrix |
| Flake, SnowflakeArm | flake_arm |

---

## Files You Should Provide to ModIQ for Training

Based on this research, the most valuable files to feed the system:

1. **Your own xlights_rgbeffects.xml** — the canonical source layout (already planned)
2. **The prop answer key Excel** — community submodel reference (already planned)
3. **PPD Certified Models** — download the .xmodel files from pixelprodisplays.com for each vendor (GE, Boscoyo, EFL). These have the best submodel definitions in the community.
4. **SOL Sequencing enhanced models** — solsequencing.com offers corrected/enhanced versions of popular models with additional submodels. Their PPD Wreath Enhanced alone adds 11 submodels.
5. **Gilbert Engineering's Google Drive** — they host all their xLights models at `drive.google.com/drive/folders/17Epn6TP-5NxAFxcFt70wS1jDoN50itc4`. Download the full folder.
6. **Community models from xlightsseq.com** — the Prop Models section has GE Spinarchy Mini, Boscoyo models, Wire Watts props, etc.
7. **3–5 community RGB effects files** — ask trusted members in the xLights Facebook group if anyone is willing to share their layout file for research. This gives ModIQ exposure to real-world naming conventions, model configurations, and layout structures. Even anonymous/stripped files would be valuable.

The PPD Certified Models are probably the single highest-value data source after your own layout, because PPD has already done the hard work of standardizing submodel names and group structures across all major vendors.
