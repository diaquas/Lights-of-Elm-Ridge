/**
 * xMap File Generator
 *
 * Stub — the canonical implementation remains in the web app at
 * src/lib/modiq/xmap-generator.ts until the matcher types are
 * extracted into the modiq package.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: The xmap format is TAB-SEPARATED TEXT, not XML.
 * Format:
 *   Line 1: "false"
 *   Line 2: Number of dest models
 *   Lines 3..N+2: Dest model names
 *   Lines N+3..: Tab-separated mapping rows (dest, sub, _, source, "white")
